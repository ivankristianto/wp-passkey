# Biometric Authentication - Login with Passkey

## Introduction

This plugin is to enable the use of [Passkeys](https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys#introduction) on WordPress. This will provide an alternative to the traditional username and password login for users and on top of that it will provide a more secure way to login to the WordPress site.

> Passkeys are a safer and easier alternative to passwords. With passkeys, users can sign in to apps and websites with a biometric sensor (such as a fingerprint or facial recognition), PIN, or pattern, freeing them from having to remember and manage passwords.
